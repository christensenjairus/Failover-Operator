/*
FailoverStages documents the stages in the failover process.

This file serves as a central documentation point for the failover process,
detailing each stage, its responsibilities, and the interactions between
different cluster operators during a failover operation.
*/

/*
Stage 1: Initialization
-----------------------
Purpose: Prepare for failover by validating prerequisites and acquiring necessary locks.

Actions:
1. Validate the failover request and prerequisites
   - Verify source and target clusters exist
   - Check cluster health and availability
   - Ensure the target cluster can receive workloads

2. Acquire lock in DynamoDB for the FailoverGroup
   - Prevents concurrent failover operations on the same group
   - Lock is cluster-aware to allow different operators to coordinate

3. Read current configuration from DynamoDB
   - Load global state including current active cluster
   - Verify expected state matches actual state

4. Set FailoverGroup status to "IN_PROGRESS"
   - Update status in both Kubernetes CR and DynamoDB

5. Log the start of the failover operation
   - Record start time, initiator, and reason

Validation Checks:
- Target cluster must exist and be in STANDBY role
- Target cluster must be healthy (OK or DEGRADED status)
- Source cluster should be in PRIMARY role
- No other failover should be in progress for this group

Outcomes:
- Failover is ready to proceed with exclusive access to the group
- Initial status is recorded for auditing and monitoring
*/

/*
Stage 2: Source Cluster Preparation
-----------------------------------
Purpose: Prepare the source cluster by stopping workloads and preparing network resources.

Actions:
1. Update network resources immediately
   - VirtualServices: Update annotations to disable DNS
     - Add "failover.io/dns-disabled: true" annotation
     - This prevents new traffic from reaching the services
   - Ingresses: Update annotations to disable DNS
     - Add "failover.io/dns-disabled: true" annotation
     - External-dns controllers will stop reconciling these resources

2. Scale down all workloads in source cluster
   - CronJobs: Suspend operations
     - Set .spec.suspend = true
   - Deployments: Scale to 0 replicas
     - Set .spec.replicas = 0
   - StatefulSets: Scale to 0 replicas
     - Set .spec.replicas = 0

3. Apply Flux annotations to prevent reconciliation
   - Add "fluxcd.io/ignore: "true"" annotation to applicable resources
   - Prevents Flux from overriding our changes during failover

4. Wait for workloads to be fully scaled down
   - Monitor replicas for each workload
   - Wait until all pods are terminated
   - Respect timeout settings from the FailoverGroup CR

Best Practices:
- Network changes should happen first to prevent traffic to in-shutdown workloads
- Monitor each workload type independently for scale-down completion
- Use exponential backoff when checking workload status

Outcomes:
- All workloads in source cluster are stopped
- Network is configured to prevent traffic to the source cluster
- The cluster is ready for volume operations
*/

/*
Stage 3: Volume Demotion (Source Cluster)
-----------------------------------------
Purpose: Safely demote volumes in the source cluster to Secondary role.

Actions:
1. Demote volumes in source cluster to Secondary
   - For each VolumeReplication resource:
     - Update .spec.replicationState = "secondary"
   - Track each volume's replication status

2. Wait for volumes to be demoted
   - Monitor .status.state of each VolumeReplication
   - Wait until all volumes report "secondary" state
   - Respect timeout settings from the FailoverGroup CR

3. Update DynamoDB to indicate volumes are ready for promotion
   - Set group.status.volumeState = "READY_FOR_PROMOTION"
   - Include timestamp and source cluster information

4. Release control to target cluster's operator
   - No direct handoff, coordination happens via DynamoDB

Technical Details:
- Volume demotion requires workloads to be fully stopped
- CSI drivers handle the actual replication role changes
- Different storage providers may have different behavior

Potential Issues:
- Volume demotion might fail if workloads are still using the volumes
- Some volumes might take longer to demote than others
- Network issues might prevent replication from completing

Outcomes:
- All volumes in source cluster are in Secondary role
- Volumes are ready to be promoted in target cluster
- DynamoDB state indicates readiness for next stage
*/

/*
Stage 4: Volume Promotion (Target Cluster)
------------------------------------------
Purpose: Safely promote volumes in the target cluster to Primary role.

Actions:
1. Target cluster's operator detects volume demotion completion
   - Polls DynamoDB for group.status.volumeState == "READY_FOR_PROMOTION"
   - Verifies the ready status is recent (within timeout window)

2. Promote volumes in target cluster to Primary
   - For each VolumeReplication resource:
     - Update .spec.replicationState = "primary"
   - Track each volume's promotion status

3. Wait for volumes to be promoted successfully
   - Monitor .status.state of each VolumeReplication
   - Wait until all volumes report "primary" state
   - Respect timeout settings from the FailoverGroup CR

4. Verify data availability
   - Perform basic read tests on volumes
   - Check filesystem mount status
   - Verify PVCs are bound and accessible

Technical Details:
- Volume promotion happens after all source volumes are demoted
- Promotion order may matter for some applications
- CSI drivers handle the actual replication role changes

Potential Issues:
- Volume promotion might fail if source didn't successfully demote
- Data inconsistency if the source cluster didn't properly flush data
- Some volumes might take longer to promote than others

Outcomes:
- All volumes in target cluster are in Primary role
- Data is available and ready for use by workloads
- System is ready for workload activation
*/

/*
Stage 5: Target Cluster Activation
----------------------------------
Purpose: Activate workloads in the target cluster and restore network connectivity.

Actions:
1. Scale up workloads in target cluster
   - StatefulSets: Scale to desired replicas
     - Set .spec.replicas to original value from DynamoDB
   - Deployments: Scale to desired replicas
     - Set .spec.replicas to original value from DynamoDB
   - CronJobs: Resume operations
     - Set .spec.suspend = false

2. Trigger Flux reconciliation if specified
   - Remove "fluxcd.io/ignore: "true"" annotations
   - For resources with triggerReconcile=true:
     - Add annotation to force reconciliation

3. Wait for workloads to be ready
   - Monitor readiness probes for each pod
   - Check deployment/statefulset status conditions
   - Verify services are properly endpoints

4. Update network resources to enable DNS
   - VirtualServices: Remove "failover.io/dns-disabled" annotation
   - Ingresses: Remove "failover.io/dns-disabled" annotation
   - External-dns controllers will start reconciling these resources

Best Practices:
- Scale StatefulSets before Deployments (data tier first)
- Monitor each workload for successful startup
- Don't enable network until workloads are confirmed ready

Potential Issues:
- Pods might fail to start if volumes aren't properly promoted
- Readiness probes might timeout if dependent services aren't available
- Deployment strategies might affect startup time

Outcomes:
- All workloads in target cluster are running
- Network is configured to route traffic to the target cluster
- The application is fully operational in the target cluster
*/

/*
Stage 6: Completion
------------------
Purpose: Finalize the failover process and update records.

Actions:
1. Update DynamoDB Group Configuration with new owner
   - Set ActiveCluster to the target cluster name
   - Update cluster roles (PRIMARY/STANDBY)
   - Update timestamp of last successful failover

2. Write History record with metrics and details
   - Record total failover time
   - Record downtime (if any)
   - Store error logs if applicable
   - Record manual or automatic nature of failover

3. Release the lock
   - Remove failover lock from DynamoDB
   - Allow other operations to proceed

4. Set FailoverGroup status to "SUCCESS"
   - Update Kubernetes CR status
   - Set completion timestamp

5. Log completion of failover operation
   - Record successful completion with metrics

Cleanup Tasks:
- Remove any temporary annotations or labels
- Clean up any staging resources used during failover
- Update monitoring systems to track new primary

Post-Failover Actions:
- Update documentation with the new active cluster
- Notify stakeholders of successful failover
- Ensure monitoring is properly configured for the new primary

Outcomes:
- Failover is complete and successful
- System state is correctly reflected in both Kubernetes and DynamoDB
- The system is ready for normal operation with the new primary cluster
*/

/*
Error Handling (Any Stage)
--------------------------
Purpose: Handle errors appropriately during any stage of the failover process.

Error Response Actions:
1. Log detailed error information
   - Include stage information
   - Include specific resource details
   - Record stack traces when available

2. Set appropriate error status in FailoverGroup
   - Update status to "FAILED"
   - Include stage where failure occurred
   - Add specific error message

3. Write failure information to History record
   - Record which stage failed
   - Store detailed error logs
   - Include any metrics collected up to failure point

4. Release locks
   - Ensure DynamoDB locks are released
   - Prevent deadlocks that block future operations

5. Clean up any partial state
   - Depending on the stage, perform partial rollback
   - Leave volumes in a safe state
   - Restore network settings if needed

Recovery Guidelines:
1. Stages 1-2: Automatic retry possible
2. Stages 3-4: Manual intervention required for volume issues
3. Stages 5-6: Could retry scale-up operations with manual approval

Common Failure Scenarios:
1. Network connectivity issues between clusters
2. Volume replication failures
3. Pod scheduling failures in target cluster
4. Insufficient resources in target cluster
5. Timeouts during state transitions

Post-Failure Actions:
- Notify administrators of the failure
- Provide detailed diagnostics information
- Suggest recovery actions based on failure type
